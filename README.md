Design files to make a hand wired Free42 calculator keyboard

As seen on Reddit, https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/hdi7p7/hand_wired_free42_calculator_keyboard/

Order your own set here, https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/61-key-custom-cherry-mx-keycap-set.html

Don't forget to set the keycap colors! All the keycaps are "charcoal", except the /? key (the one next to the right-shift), is "orange".

And here's the layout, http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/66d7023200c0f85745199b2e1fa60b12
